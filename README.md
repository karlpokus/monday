# monday
A fancy todolist with minimal UI in browser and as a chrome extension. Designed for use on desktop by keyboard alone. Not really mobile friendly. Persistant storage as default.

# usage
- add new item at prompt by `return`
- navigate items by `tab`
- remove item by replacing text with `done` or leave it blank
- edit item by adding text
